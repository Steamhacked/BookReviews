In order to properly Define Property, firstly it should be required which socioeconomic group of people will be in focus:
  1) The Poor
  2) The Non-Poor
  3) Both
The author decided to not consider option (2), presumably due to its "grotesque" nature

There are various approaches to indentify and describe property, some may choose to focus on suffering of poor, while others may look through the perspective of an entire nation

The second aspect that requires clarification is measurement of the poverty overall

  One of the more popular methods is expressing overall poverty as a ratio of poor population to an entire population. 
  This method has 2 significant disadvantages:
    1) It does not account for income of empoverished
    2) It does not account for wealth distribution among empoverished

Identifying the poor and aggregating characteristics of the poor, is a topic covererd in the following chapters, this chapter's main focus is conceptual

Approaches to Conceptualization of Poverty:
  Biological: total earnings - insufficient to obtain minimum neccessities to support physical efficiency.
  The drawbacks of the approach:
    1) Imprecise definition, of minimum nutrition required. Nutritional requirements can vary greatly depending on region, climate, ethnic group, etc. Some cases record people being able to survive, while rather inadequate diet
    2) The approach fails to account for individual consumption habits, while it is possible to mathematically solve "diet problem", it does not neccessarily mean that one is not empoverished, if it means consuming the same ration daily, out of spite
    3) It is rather challenging to define precisely non-food minimum requirements, as well as proportion of income spent on food

  While the biological approach and each of it's procedures can be reasonably argued and criticized, the approach is not to be disregarded completely. Despite the vague nature of the definition of minimum nutrition it is an inherent aspect of the definition and identification of povery, therefore it is not necessarily a condition to completely exclude approach from consideration. Regarding focus on the income, it is something that can be properly omitted or made more precise by including observations of community's habits and behavior. The approach centers around food, which is not necessarily a drawback, since of all the characteristics of poverty, this one has a greater significance

Inequality: one of the main advantages of labeling poverty as inequality is the nature of action taken towards inequality. Rather than treating the problem as an area to study and approach it with redundant theorizing and pseudoscience, it focuses on the gap between lowest socioeconomic group to the rest and reducing it.
A few problems regarding this approach:
  1) Fails to identify decadence in poverty, due to it's somewhat comparative and non-empirical nature. If
