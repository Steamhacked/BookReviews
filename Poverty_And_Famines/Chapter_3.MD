Identification of the Poor:

Commodities vs Characteristics:

  Basic needs can be measured by commodities (rice, bread, etc.) and characteristics (calories, proteins, etc.). Multiple different commodities can cover specific set of characteristics, however, one characteristic does not necessarily can be derived from multiple sources (e.g.: education, housing). Asides from lack of feasible alternative sources, some commodities may be deemed unfeasible by the populations consumption habbits (e.g.: a community selects, only rice as a source of carbohydrates)

  The problem of consumption habbits can be limited either by specifying characteristic as "calories per unit rice" or by deeming rice to be only feasible source of calories, the 2 approaches can lead to different policy-making. In order to better identify basic needs, taking consumption habbits into account is crucial

  Conventionally basic needs are defined as a combination of characteristics and commodities

Direct vs Income:

  Direct method of identification of poor simly checks if an actual consumption basket satisfies basic needs. Income method, on the other hand, first defines minimum income required to meet basic needs, which is then used to identify if a person is poor

  Direct method is advantageous in a way that it requires no assumption regarding consumption habits. Only if there is no information on consumption habits, a case for income method can be made

  The income method, however, too has it's advantages. The income method captures individual's ability to meet basic needs, even if such ability is not utilized. Thus, a fasting ascetic, poor - by direct method, will be identified otherwise by income method

  The two methods provide two different concepts of poverty, one that identifies when consumption fails to meet minimum, another that identifies one who is unable to meet minimum due to behavioral constraints (consumption habits)

Poverty line may not necessarily be uniform, as in certain regions, prices may vary depending on the group

Family Equivalence: Another uncertainty to address is identifying poverty of a family as a population unit. There are several uncertainties that need to be resolved. Basic needs of different family members will vary, the distribution may not necessarily be adequate, etc.

  Adult Human Equivalent: One possible method of resolving this is converting a family into the "adult-human equivalent". The issues with this approach is that it deals with various ambiguous factors, such as consumption behavior, maldistribution, validity of defined nutritional standards, etc.

  Perception Method: Analyzing people's perception of how much extra income is required in order to remain at the same living standard with a bigger family. (Showed consistency in some research)

  Ratio Method: Analyze families' income distribution (differently-sized families spending same percentage of income for food are considered same level of poverty)

  Weighing of size-variant Families:

    1) Constant Household Weight: Defining constant weight of a household, disregarding size, it is an inadequate method, due to obvious underestimation of suffering of families of the bigger size

    2) Constant Human Weight: Defining each individual's level of poverty, taking note of individual's family size and composition

    3) Adult-Human Equivalent Weight: Defining weight of a family based on the number of equivalent adults in it; While sensible on surface, it is somewhat unrepresentative, since suffering of each family members is at the interest, rather than suffering of hypothetical adult equivalents

Income gap - amount of income shortcoming for a person to meet minimum income

Relative Deprivation: Poverty of 2 empoverished individuals is not necessarily equivalent, and can be quantified through income gap, thus potentially making one appear to be poorer than another. In an example of money transfer between person 1 relatively deprived to person 2, the absolute-shortfall from poverty line decreases for person 1 and increases for person 2, thus obiously increasing overall relative deprivation (both in terms of income and utility)

Critique of Standard Measurements of Poverty:

  Head-Count: H = q/n; H -> poverty index, q -> empoverished part of population, n -> total population
  Income-Gap Ratio: Net income shortfalls from poverty line. Possibly normalized by taking shortfall of average income of empoverished, from the poverty line

  Head-Count: Fails to take into account severity of the poverty, equating groups that are just below from poverty line and groups that are extremely far below from it

  Income-Gap: Fails to account for an actual number of empoverished

  Combining both Methods, is not necessarily an adequate measurements, since it fails to account for income distribution among poor
