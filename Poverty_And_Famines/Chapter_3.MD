Identification of the Poor:

Commodities vs Characteristics:

  Basic needs can be measured by commodities (rice, bread, etc.) and characteristics (calories, proteins, etc.). Multiple different commodities can cover specific set of characteristics, however, one characteristic does not necessarily can be derived from multiple sources (e.g.: education, housing). Asides from lack of feasible alternative sources, some commodities may be deemed unfeasible by the populations consumption habbits (e.g.: a community selects, only rice as a source of carbohydrates)

  The problem of consumption habbits can be limited either by specifying characteristic as "calories per unit rice" or by deeming rice to be only feasible source of calories, the 2 approaches can lead to different policy-making. In order to better identify basic needs, taking consumption habbits into account is crucial

  Conventionally basic needs are defined as a combination of characteristics and commodities

Direct vs Income:

  Direct method of identification of poor simly checks if an actual consumption basket satisfies basic needs. Income method, on the other hand, first defines minimum income required to meet basic needs, which is then used to identify if a person is poor

  Direct method is advantageous in a way that it requires no assumption regarding consumption habits. Only if there is no information on consumption habits, a case for income method can be made
