Starvation should be analyzed with regard to 3 factors:
  1) Low levels of consumption
  2) Declining trend of consumption
  3) Sudden collapse of consumption

Famine is usually triggered by 3rd factor, the first two usually lead up to famine, but not necessarily start it.

When famine occurs, it does not necessarily hit all the groups within community. While famine is something that urges to focus on food supply, it is no less a matter of food distribution

Pesonal Comments:
The chapter appears to be mostly analysis of past consumption trends in India and Japan, overall it does not appear to be insightful
