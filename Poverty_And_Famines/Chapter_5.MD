Starvation can be caused by 2 possible factors:
  1) Lack of legal means to acquire food
  2) Underutilization of those means

The Entitlement Approach: focuses on the people's command of food through legal means.
In a state economy, a person is entitled to a bundle of commodities. In a free-market economy, a person is entitled to endowment (bundle of comodities) and an exchange mapping (trade). 

Thus, an individual becomes starved, either due to low endowment or due to unfavorable exchange mapping
