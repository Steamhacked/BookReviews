Starvation can be caused by 2 possible factors:
  1) Lack of legal means to acquire food
  2) Underutilization of those means

The Entitlement Approach: focuses on the people's command of food through legal means.
In a state economy, a person is entitled to a bundle of commodities. In a free-market economy, a person is entitled to endowment (bundle of comodities) and an exchange mapping (trade). 

Thus, an individual becomes starved, either due to low endowment or due to unfavorable exchange mapping

Limitations of Entitlement Approach:
  1) Fails to account for illegal food acquisition
  2) Inherently vague, due to uncertainties in terms of entitlement
  3) Fails to account for consumption habits, that result into people consuming less than entitled amount
  4) Focuses on starvation mortality, not famine mortality
