Strarvation is a term describing a situation in which a group of people does not have enough to eat, it is does not necessarily imply lack of food.

Starvation is not necessarily caused by shortage in food supply, several other factors play role:
  1) Ownership
  2) Exchange Entitlement
  3) Means of Production
  4) Social Security
Therefore whether one will face starvation can dependent on one's: ownership status, job title which dictates means of production, purchasing power and status for social security benefits. These factors are mostly dependent on said person's government's economic structure and laws. 

In context of free market capitalist economy: Landless Labourer, due to having less versatile and effective means of production, will most likely be more prone to starvation, than a share-cropper.

In context of socialist economy, the situation can be different, since land ownership is not recognized in a similar way. 

The chapter provides notes on various terminology and background information in order to understand starvation, beyond food supply.
